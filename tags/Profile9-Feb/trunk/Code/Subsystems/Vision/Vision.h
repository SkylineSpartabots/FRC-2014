/**
 * From the 2014 Vision Sample.
 * 
 * Program using NIVision to find rectangles in the scene that are illuminated
 * by a green LED ring light.
 * 
 * The CriteriaCollection is the set of criteria that is used to filter the set of
 * rectangles that are detected. In this example we're looking for rectangles with
 * a minimum width of 30 pixels and maximum of 400 pixels.
 * 
 * The algorithm first does a color threshold operation that only takes objects in the
 * scene that have a bright green color component. Then a small object filter
 * removes small particles that might be caused by green reflection scattered from other 
 * parts of the scene. Finally all particles are scored on rectangularity, and aspect ratio,
 * to determine if they are a target.
 * 
 * The camera settings for optimal results are:
 * 
 * M1013
 * - Color Level: 50
 * - Brightness: 0
 * - Sharpness: 50
 * - Contrast: 50
 * 
 * - White balance: Fixed Indoor
 * - Exposure value: 0
 * - Enable Backlight compensation (unchecked)
 * - Exposure Priority: Motion
 * 
 * 206/M1011
 * - White balance: Automatic
 * - Exposure control: Automatic
 * - Exposure priority: None
